## My process

### Built with

- HTML

- CSS

- Flexbox

- Grid

### What I learned

Changing the view for the differenct devices in order to be responsive turned out to be a challenge regarding the hero image(s). In the end I found a solution that looks good. Initially I used an HTML img-tag in the index.html, but changed that to using a background-image in CSS in order to change it depending on the screensize of the viewer.
